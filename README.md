## Usage
The player must first enter the number of lives or the number of times she/he wishes to resume the game after dropping the ball.

Each brick stands for a word. As the ball hits the bricks, the score keeps changing depending on the length of the word corresponding to the brick that was hit. Once the player runs out of lives, the game ends and the final score is displayed.
